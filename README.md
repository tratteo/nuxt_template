# Nuxt badass template

You can use this template as a starting point for any of your Nuxt projects. Enjoy!

### Changelog
- Nuxt UI `^4.0.0` has become free! ([blog post here](https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-ui-v4)). I have changed the Blog section in order to use all the new Nuxt UI components.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to still check how to implement all the components natively, refer to commit [a96557f](https://github.com/tratteo/nuxt_template/tree/a96557f941936dc572fe216ec182421811752975)

### Intergations and features
Here are all the current integration and features. For each one of them I released a video tutorial on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@matteo-beltrame), go check it out.
There are other videos about different components and other tutorials. Be sure to run the project and explore the main page to check them all out!
