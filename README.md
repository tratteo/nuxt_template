# Nuxt badass template

You can use this template as a starting point for any of your Nuxt projects. Enjoy!
 > [!IMPORTANT]
 > Each time I do major changes I try to make a video on my [YouTube channel](!https://www.youtube.com/@matteo-beltrame). However, I am constantly improving this template, this means I may switch different pacakges in new versions and update dependencies.

### Changelog
- Swapped from `chartjs` to `echarts`: simply because I think it is better, configuration is handled more easily.
- Nuxt UI `^4.0.0` has become free! ([blog post here](https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-ui-v4)). I have changed the Blog section in order to use all the new Nuxt UI components.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to still check how to implement all the components natively, refer to commit [a96557f](https://github.com/tratteo/nuxt_template/tree/a96557f941936dc572fe216ec182421811752975)
